# Repository Description

This repository contains an implementation for an offline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The model is based on various technologies, software, and platforms, primarily:

1. [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

2. Langchain

3. Mistral

4. FAISS

5. Streamline

## Main Model Description

This model utilizes the Ollama software tool to run large language models (LLMs) locally on a computer, enabling offline language processing tasks. Ollama provides access to a diverse set of pre-trained LLM models. Langchain complements Ollama by acting as a framework, allowing developers to integrate these locally-run LLMs into applications. This makes the LLMs easier to use and build upon. Langchain goes a step further by enabling the development of RAG systems, which use various tools to process information, resulting in more refined and informative responses from the language model.

## Using the RAG

1. Install Ollama from [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the application
4. The server will open the application as shown in the picture. You can use your PDF documents or the two documents provided in the example folder. The Example folder contains two PDF documents generated by ChatGPT including information about dams.

## Main Functions Explanation

The image illustrates the overall steps of the model. It begins with uploading multiple PDF files, followed by processing them before engaging in conversation, as outlined below:

1. Call the `get_pdf_text(pdf_docs)` function to read and concatenate text from each page of the uploaded PDF documents.
   - **Main method** for parsing: PyPDF2 library.
   - **Output**: raw_text

2. Call the `get_text_chunks(raw_text)` function to split the extracted text into manageable chunks.
   - **Main method**: langchain library.
   - **CharacterTextSplitter Parameters**: chunk size: 1000 characters, overlap: 200 characters.
   - **Output**: text_chunks

3. Call the `get_vectorstore(text_chunks)` function to generate embeddings for the text chunks and store them in a vector database.
   - **Main method**:
     - **Embeddings**: [HuggingFace Instructor-XL](https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-xl)
     - **FAISS**: A library for efficient similarity search. [More info](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/)
   - **Convert the embeddings vectorspace to txt file (embeddings.txt)**

4. Call the `get_conversation_chain(vectorstore)` function to create a conversational chain with the generated vectorstore.
   - **This operation relies on the langchain library for creating conversational chains.**
