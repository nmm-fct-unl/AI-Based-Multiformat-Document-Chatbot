undermining its reliability as an indicator of recent fecal contamination. Given the capacity of
environmental strains of E. coli to replicate in the environment, the objective of this research work was to
investigate whether any of the routinely measured parameters could predict the onset of an E. coli bloom in
drinking water reservoirs. Information from historical catchment, weather, and water quality data were
extracted for a number of Australian reservoirs that experienced E. coli blooms. Data were preprocessed and
analyzed with time series analysis, linear and nonlinear regression, and self‐organizing maps. Findings
suggest that warm water, dry catchments, algal blooms, and nutrient availability were important factors in
increasing the propensity for a bloom. Nutrient availability can be affected by many extrinsic factors that are

often not well characterized, such as bushfires and back burning, decomposition of aquatic species, and dust
storms. Based on data analysis outputs, a data‐driven Bayesian Network model was developed, which,
considering the paucity of data for some key input parameters, should only be used to trigger more intensive
monitoring programs whenever the predicted risk of a bloom exceeds predetermined key thresholds. Such
new data could be fed into the model to continuously improve its accuracy, and to eventually predict and
proactively manage future blooms.
1. Introduction
Total coliforms are defined as gram‐negative, facultative anaerobic, rod‐shaped bacteria. As some strains can
grow in the environment outside of the gastric tract, coliforms are considered to be unreliable indicators of
chunk_2: grow in the environment outside of the gastric tract, coliforms are considered to be unreliable indicators of
sewage contamination (Tyagi et al., 2006). On the other hand, Escherichia coli has been commonly used as an
indicator since it is more likely to be associated with fecal contamination (Cumberland et al., 2012), and a
number of studies have been conducted to model its concentrations and transport mechanisms in water
environments (e.g., Hondzo and Al‐Homoud (2007) or Dwivedi et al. (2013)). However, there is increasing
evidence against it being an accurate indicator of fecal input (Blyton & Gordon, 2017); for instance, there
seems to be a number of different phenotypes of E. coli, with some appearing to have adapted to a planktonic
lifestyle in aquatic ecosystems and able to persist and replicate under favorable conditions, causing blooms.
Others can survive outside of animal hosts by entering a viable but nonculturable state. Under this hypothesis,

bacterial cells would enter a dormant state and could “resuscitate” given certain environmental conditions
such as favorable temperature, pH, carbon, and nutrients (Pinto et al., 2011; Wei & Zhao, 2018;
Winfield & Groisman, 2003). Considering that in Australia, where this research was conducted, the
Australian Drinking Water Guidelines (NHRMC, 2011) presently do not cover environmental or blooming
E. coli, it is important to better understand it and explore the potential for predicting blooms. Based on this,
the main objective of this study, which was part of a larger project (Sinclair, 2019), was to collect and analyze
historical catchment data for a number of Australian reservoirs and investigate whether there were any
parameter which were significantly correlated to the occurrence of environmental E. coli blooms. A second

objective was, based on the results of the data analysis, to develop a predictive model for environmental E.
coli blooms. A probabilistic approach was used, and a Bayesian Network (BN) model was developed for this
task. BNs have been extensively applied in environmental modeling (Aguilera et al., 2011) and in the prediction
of health‐related water quality events (Bertone, Sahin, et al., 2016) and represent an ideal modeling
approach for uncertain, data‐scarce systems (Barton et al., 2012; Uusitalo, 2007).

1.1. Background
An increasing number of studies seem to prove that measurements of fecal indicator organisms might not be
not suitable for characterizing human health risks in water (Byappanahalli et al., 2006; Edge et al., 2013;
Ishii & Sadowsky, 2008; Luo et al., 2011; Perchec‐Merien & Lewis, 2013; Whitman et al., 2003).
Nevertheless, E. coli is a water quality indicator that is extensively used in both fresh and marine waters
chunk_6: Nevertheless, E. coli is a water quality indicator that is extensively used in both fresh and marine waters
worldwide. This bacterium is both genetically and phenotypically diverse (Ishii & Sadowsky, 2008), coming
from a range of sources including humans (Odonkor & Ampofo, 2013), other warm‐blooded mammals such
as cattle (Friesema et al., 2011) or poultry (Johnson et al., 2007), and environmental sources. A number of
research studies have isolated environmental E. coli strains from both soil and water, demonstrating through
DNA fingerprinting that they are distinct from animal‐borne isolates (Byappanahalli et al., 2006; Ishii et al.,
2006). Importantly, environmental strains of E. coli have been reported to bloom in the environment, resulting
in high concentrations in waters in the absence of fecal input or human pathogens (Anderson
et al., 2005).

In a recent review paper, Jang et al. (2017) provide, among other, a list of environmental factors which can
affect survival and growth of E. coli. High freshwater temperatures (e.g., exceeding 18 °C) and availability of
nutrients are cited most frequently as the two most important variables involved in the survival and growth
of environmental E. coli strains (Byappanahalli et al., 2006; Davies et al., 1995; Edge et al., 2013; Faust et al.,
1975; Ishii & Sadowsky, 2008; Liu et al., 2006; Winfield & Groisman, 2003). Specific nutrients include carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur (Anderson et al., 2005; Faust et al., 1975; Ishii & Sadowsky, 2008).
Other promoting factors suggested in previous research include presence of aquatic flora (Perchec‐Merien
& Lewis, 2013; Whitman et al., 2003), rainfall/droughts (Edge et al., 2013; Whitman et al., 2004), preceding

dust storms or bushfires (Chafer, 2007; Power et al., 2005), and presence of macrophytic algae and sand (Ishii
& Sadowsky, 2008; Sadowsky & Whitman, 2011). Conversely, the magnitude of, and exposure to, solar radiation
is the primary mechanism for E. coli decay (Anderson et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2011). This is supported by
experiments described in Whitman et al. (2004) who showed that the time of sampling can have a significant
impact on E. coli counts, with samples taken at 7 a.m. being up to 70% higher than samples taken at 10 a.m.
on the same day, due to solar radiation (Whitman et al., 2004).
The comprehensive analysis of the data set from five, substantially different reservoirs, provides an opportunity
to identify on a larger scale which specific parameters, suggested in previous research, are correlated
consistently with E. coli blooms.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data Collection and Analysis
Historical water quality data were obtained from five reservoirs around Australia located in different climatic
zones, namely (Figure 1),
1. Grahamstown Dam (GT‐New South Wales‐Maximum capacity: 182,305 ML)
2. Warragamba Dam (WD‐New South Wales‐Maximum capacity: 2,310 GL)
3. Hinze Dam (HD‐Queensland‐Maximum capacity: 310,730 ML)
4. Maroon Dam (MD‐Queensland‐Maximum capacity: 44,319 ML)
5. Millstream Dam (WA‐Western Australia‐Maximum capacity: 810 ML).
Weather data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and other types of data (e.g., land use and
bushfire/dust storm occurrences) from water utilities or other governmental agencies were acquired. The
data covered a wide range of frequencies (hourly to yearly), duration (from less than 5 years for
chunk_10: data covered a wide range of frequencies (hourly to yearly), duration (from less than 5 years for
Millstream Dam to over 20 for Warragamba Dam), and unit/method of measurement (e.g., colony‐forming
units or CFU and most probable number or MPN for E. coli). An important missing information was the culture
temperature applied for the total coliform counts, as environmental isolates might have optimum
growth at different temperature to mammalian sources.
The available data were first described by plotting each variable independently to visualize trends. Overlay
plots were then created to visualize trends between E. coli counts and other available weather and water
quality parameters, including key variables identified in the literature and
